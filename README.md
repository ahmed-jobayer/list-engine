# 🧠 ListEngine

**ListEngine** is a productivity-focused tool built for e-commerce sellers who need to generate large sets of product listing titles and descriptions efficiently. Designed especially for platforms like **Amazon** and **Walmart**, ListEngine automates one of the most repetitive and time-consuming parts of the product listing process — creating unique titles for each product variant (e.g., color and size combinations).

## 🚀 Project Vision

As a product lister working in the e-commerce space, I often face a frustrating and repetitive challenge:  
When listing items that come in many variants — such as 10 colors and 8 sizes — I have to manually write out **80 unique product titles**. These titles follow a pattern, but writing them out manually wastes time and drains focus.

This tool is my attempt to solve that real-world problem using my web development skills.

## 🎯 What ListEngine Will Do

- Let users define a **base product title** structure  
- Accept dynamic variant inputs like **colors**, **sizes**, or **materials**  
- Automatically generate all **possible combinations** of product titles  
- Provide an easy way to **copy**, **export**, or **save** generated results  
- (Future Scope) Allow bulk generation of **bullet point descriptions** or **SEO-optimized content**
